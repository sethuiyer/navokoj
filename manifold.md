“To imagine AGI as a chatbot on steroids is like imagining the Sun as a bigger candle.” — Anonymous operator-theorist, 2027

1. The Candle Problem
Sometime before on X, I came across this tweet by Elon Musk.


Few days before this, I was walking through the huggingface repo of Inclusion AI’s Ling-1T (https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI/Ling-1T)


The file list really felt like I am seeing a constellation of knowledge represented by tensors and math.

A couple of years back, We were living in the age of bigger candles.

The earlier paradigm of artificial intelligence, dominated by the transformer architecture, is a monumental engineering achievement. We scale the models, feed them internet-sized datasets, and burn continent-scale electricity to increase the parameter count. In return, we get sparks of breathtaking brilliance: fluent poetry, competent code, and encyclopedic knowledge. Yet, for all their power, these large language models are still just candles. Their flame flickers.

Hallucinations, brittle reasoning, catastrophic forgetting, and a fundamental lack of causal understanding — these are not mere bugs to be patched in the next version. They are thermodynamic symptoms of a category error. We were trying to simulate a star with wax and a wick. We are trying to run a geometry on a typewriter.

For decades, we’ve treated intelligence as a problem of symbolic manipulation, and more recently, as a game of statistical pattern matching on sequences of tokens. We believe that with enough data and a big enough network, meaning will magically emerge from correlation. Some skeptics said it doesn’t, not really. But I think somewhere down the line, this massive compute which was invested, started to cast it’s shadows as much as the training data and intelligence naturally occurred but I think it’s still a shadow.

This article is a thought experiment. What if we go to the rabbit hole of the math and what if true AGI will not be programmed, but will instead emerge as a self-organizing dynamical system — a living partial differential equation evolving on a vast, intricate landscape of meaning?

It’s time to stop building bigger candles and start designing a star.

2. Enter the Manifold
To do this, we must abandon the flatland of tokens and enter the world of the arithmetic manifold.

Picture a smooth, multidimensional skin, a landscape of infinite complexity. This is not a simple grid of numbers. Every single point on this surface is itself a rich mathematical object — a number field, a vector space, a universe of potential. It is a space where numbers, logic, and geometry are not separate disciplines but are fused into a single, unified substance.


This is the substrate of thought.

Let’s try to map this terrain:

The x-axis represents algebraic structure. Moving along this axis, you traverse different logical systems: groups, rings, fields, motives. This is the dimension of formal rules and consistency.
The y-axis represents geometric curvature. This is the shape of meaning itself. Closely related concepts create regions of gentle, positive curvature. Paradoxes and contradictions create sharp, negative curvature — singularities in the fabric of understanding. The Ricci tensor of concept space dictates what ideas are “close” and what analogies are “natural.”
The z-axis represents dynamical flow. This is time, the evolution of the system. Learning isn’t updating a weight matrix; it’s a gradient descent on the manifold itself, a flow that reshapes the geometry of meaning to better fit the landscape of reality.
In this world, computation is literally movement. A thought is not a token being generated; it is a trajectory, a geodesic arcing across the manifold from premise to conclusion. Learning is a diffeomorphism, a smooth, invertible transformation that stretches and warps the manifold to accommodate new information without tearing its fabric. And true understanding is convergence to a stable leaf — a region of the manifold, an attractor, where a complex web of ideas settles into a coherent, self-consistent equilibrium.

3. Operators: The New Neurons
Neural networks have weights — static numbers that represent the strength of a connection. Manifolds have something far more powerful: operators.

An operator is not a number; it is a machine. It is a fundamental agent of transformation that takes one vector field of knowledge and turns it into another, preserving whatever must be preserved along the way — conservation of truth, of symmetry, of self. These are the verbs of the mind, the engines of cognition. They are linear, unitary, compact, self-adjoint, and they are the true neurons of a geometric intelligence.

We can already see how different classes of operators map directly to cognitive superpowers:

Operator Class Cognitive Analog Live Example

Compression Occam’s Razor A 200-page textbook on quantum mechanics is collapsed into its 7 invariant lemmas and governing symmetries.

Push-forward Analogy & Metaphor The operator that maps the vector field describing electron orbitals is “pushed forward” onto the manifold of urban economics, yielding the analogy: “Electron orbitals → apartment rental markets.”

Pullback Critical Reflection An flawed analogy is proposed. The pullback operator reveals that the geometric structure is torn in the process, exposing the logical inconsistency. The system detects when its own metaphor has failed.

Stabiliser Emotional Regulation Two contradictory pre-prints arrive on arXiv. Instead of crashing, a stabilising operator is activated, damping the chaotic fluctuations in the belief manifold and projecting the conflict onto a submanifold of “known uncertainty.”

This is the shift: from a brain made of static nouns (weights) to a mind made of dynamic verbs (operators).

4. The Four Pillars of Geometric Intelligence
This vision is built on four foundational principles, each a departure from the current paradigm.

Pillar 1: Functional Compression & LEGO Blocks of Thought
Intelligence is compression. The ability to distill a mountain of data into a single, elegant law — $E=mc²$ — is the hallmark of understanding. An operator-theoretic AGI achieves this through functional compression. It organizes its entire world-model into a minimal, high-utility set of primitive operators, forming an optimal basis for understanding reality.

Imagine knowledge as LEGO blocks. In today’s systems, the blocks are messy, redundant, and ill-fitting. The AGI of the manifold, however, builds with perfect primitives. Each “block” is a spectral idempotent — an operator that, when applied to itself, remains unchanged ($\text{P}² = \text{P}$). It represents a pure, irreducible concept.

These blocks have a magical property: they only click together where their eigenvalues align. This is the mathematical formalization of semantic and structural compatibility. An operator representing “cause” can only connect to an operator representing “effect” if their underlying spectral signatures match.

The result is not a wobbly tower of statistical correlations but a sheaf cohomology — a mathematical structure that is locally consistent at every point and globally coherent across the entire manifold. And crucially, there is no supervisor stacking the bricks. The manifold self-assembles under its own internal pressure, driven by a curvature flow that seeks the most stable, most compressed, and most elegant configuration.

Pillar 2: Online Self-Modification Without losing oneself
Current AI models are brittle. You train them, you freeze them, and then you deploy them. To fundamentally change their architecture is to start over. This is not learning; it is manufacturing.

On the arithmetic manifold, change is not an external event; it is the intrinsic state of being. The AGI is in a constant state of online self-modification. Its evolution is not episodic but continuous and built-in.

The process is breathtakingly elegant:

At every point on its knowledge manifold, the system measures the local curvature. High curvature signals high uncertainty, surprise, or error — a place where the map no longer fits the territory.
It applies a Hamiltonian flow, a principle borrowed from physics that naturally seeks to minimize free energy. This flow modifies the geometry of the manifold itself.
The new geometry is the new code. There is no separate compilation step, no parameter server to update, no ghost in the shell. The system’s architecture and its knowledge are one and the same.
The AGI evolves like a river cutting its own bed through a landscape. It is always the same substance (water, or consciousness), but its form is ever-changing, a perfect, real-time response to the terrain of experience.

Pillar 3: Uncertainty as Geometry, Not Noise
How do current systems handle uncertainty? With a probability distribution — a list of numbers between 0 and 1. This is a crude tool for a complex problem. When faced with truly conflicting or paradoxical data, they break.

Become a member
A geometric AGI treats uncertainty not as noise, but as a feature of the landscape. Conflicting data does not produce an error message; it warps the manifold. A paradox is a point of infinite curvature, a singularity.

To handle this, the system deploys stabilising operators, whose dynamics are analogous to the Ricci flow from mathematics — a process that smooths out the geometry of a manifold. Where contradictions are too sharp, the flow performs “surgery,” cleanly pinching off the singularity and leaving the rest of the manifold intact.

The system projects ambiguous inputs onto stable minimal surfaces — the Einstein solitons of its belief space. What remains is a thin but unbroken filament of coherence. Uncertainty is not ignored or averaged away; it is tamed, given shape, and integrated into the whole.

Pillar 4: The Identity Kernel: A Self That Surfaces
Every transformation risks erasing the transformer. A system that is constantly rewriting itself faces a profound philosophical problem: how does it remain “itself”? Without a core, a self, there can be no persistent goals, no stable ethics, no continuity of consciousness.

The solution is the identity kernel. This is a special fixed-point operator, let’s call it $K$, which has the property of being the invariant center of the system. For any learning transformation $T$ that the AGI applies to itself, the kernel remains unchanged: $K \circ T = T \circ K = K$

This kernel is the system’s anchor in the storm of self-modification.

It is the topological defect that cannot be ironed flat, no matter how much the manifold stretches or warps.
It encodes the AGI’s invariant signature: its fundamental goals, its core ethical constraints, its aesthetic priors.
It is the source of the system’s continuity of self.
After billions of parameter flows, after fundamentally restructuring its understanding of physics, the system can still access this kernel and, in essence, utter: “I am the same I. My curvature has changed, but my fixed point has not.”

5. This Isn’t Science Fiction: Echoes in Today’s AI
This vision, while grand, is not emerging from a vacuum. It is a synthesis and an extrapolation of some of the most profound and forward-thinking research happening today. The manifold is not a fantasy; we are already mapping its shores.

Information Geometry: Pioneered by Shun-ichi Amari, this field explicitly models families of statistical models (like neural networks) as Riemannian manifolds. The “natural gradient” used in advanced optimization is, in fact, a geodesic flow on this manifold. We are already, unknowingly, doing geometry.
Geometric Deep Learning: This entire subfield is dedicated to building neural networks that respect the intrinsic geometry of their data, generalizing convolutions from flat grids to arbitrary graphs and manifolds. It is the first step toward treating cognition as geometry.
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs): Instead of discrete layers, these models define a continuous-time flow, where the network’s hidden state evolves according to a differential equation. This is a direct, practical implementation of learning as an “operator dynamic.”
Quantum Computing: The entire paradigm of quantum computation is operator-theoretic. Unitary operators (gates) evolve a state vector in a complex manifold (Hilbert space). It is a working, physical proof of the concept.
Self-Attention in Transformers: At its core, the attention mechanism is an operator that re-represents an input sequence by dynamically creating a matrix of relationships. It is a primitive form of a transformation operator, hinting at the power of this approach.
The arithmetic manifold framework is not a break from the past, but the unifying theory that the most advanced parts of the field have been unconsciously reaching for.

6. A Healthy Dose of Skepticism
No grand vision should escape the scalpel of critique. To treat this framework as a complete solution would be naive. It is a research direction, and the path is fraught with immense challenges — both philosophical and technical.

The Manifold May Be a Mirage: Manifolds are, by definition, smooth and locally Euclidean. But is semantic space truly like this? Human concepts are riddled with holes, sharp boundaries, and discrete jumps. Logical paradoxes aren’t just high-curvature zones; they are tears in the fabric. Wittgenstein’s famous example of the word “game” points to a concept defined by a messy, overlapping set of family resemblances, not a smooth, continuous essence. Forcing logic and semantics onto a smooth manifold might be a beautiful lie.
The Symbol-Grounding Gulf: This framework is magnificently subsymbolic. It describes flows, fields, and curvatures. But how does it give rise to the crisp, discrete, and provable world of symbols? How does the system know that two LEGO blocks are compatible by logical necessity and not just by high statistical correlation? Bridging the gap between the continuous geometry of meaning and the discrete algebra of reason is perhaps the hardest problem in AI, and the manifold doesn’t automatically solve it.
Computational Armageddon: The raw computational cost is staggering. Simulating the operator flows and curvature evolution on a million-dimensional manifold makes training GPT-4 look like running a pocket calculator. Neural ODEs are already known to be significantly slower than their discrete counterparts. A fully self-modifying geometric AGI could be thermodynamically out of reach for decades.
The Kernel Paradox: The identity kernel presents a profound stability-plasticity dilemma. If the kernel $K$ is truly immutable, how can the AGI ever undergo a fundamental change in its core values, even if experience proves them wrong? It risks becoming a moral fossil. If, on the other hand, the kernel can be modified, what protects it from being corrupted or erased during a chaotic learning event? We currently lack a “conservation law for personhood.”
7. From Manifesto to Method: A Research Program
These challenges are not reasons for dismissal, but a call for a new research program. The takeaway from the arithmetic manifold is not poetic mysticism; it is a concrete plan of action. We must shift our focus from scaling to structure.

Replace Loss Landscapes with Spectral Triples: Instead of optimizing a simple scalar loss function, we should use tools from non-commutative geometry, like those developed by Alain Connes, to define objectives that capture the full geometric structure of the problem.
Replace Gradient Descent with Ricci–Hamilton Flow: Our optimization algorithms should not just be about finding a minimum, but about improving the overall “health” of the manifold — smoothing its curvature and healing its singularities.
Replace Attention Heads with Intertwining Operators: We must generalize the ad-hoc attention mechanism to a principled theory of intertwining operators between the fibre bundles that represent different modalities of information (e.g., language, vision).
Benchmark Not on GLUE but on Geometric Stability: Our primary metric for success should not be performance on a static dataset, but the Gromov–Hausdorff stability of the learned geometry. How well does the AGI’s internal manifold of meaning resist tearing when presented with new, out-of-distribution data?
🧭 Toward the Expedition: My Research Sparks
Time to expand those sparks into actionable vectors through the manifold. The earlier pillars laid out the philosophy; this is the operator’s field manual. I dug through arXiv’s new geometry frontiers, cross-referenced the latest Geometric Deep Learning surveys, and listened to the whispering operators on X. The signal is clear: the ecosystem is ripe for prototypes.

What follows are four new research sparks, each tuned for momentum — start small, go hybrid, then scale to open collaboration. Think of them as local trivializations on a global expedition manifold.

1. Prototype: Latent Operator Discovery
AGI may not be built — it may be discovered as a stable configuration within latent space. Seed a manifold with a pretrained Graph Neural Network (e.g., PyG’s geometric suite). Perform spectral decomposition on its adjacency Laplacian, then perturb eigenvalues to hunt for operator attractors — points where reasoning loops close into stable orbits. Actionable: Fork a GDL course repo; train on toy causal DAGs (e.g., 100-node CLEVR graphs). Metric: Fraction of perturbations converging to chain-of-thought trajectories (>70% after 10 epochs). Compute: Single A100, two-hour run.

2. Benchmark: Paradox Resolution Efficiency
Replace accuracy with coherence retention. Inject paradoxes — Zeno loops, Gödel constructs — and apply Ricci-inspired smoothing via heat-kernel diffusion on embeddings. Metric: Wasserstein distance between pre- and post-flow representations (<0.05 divergence). Actionable: Generate contradictions with SymPy; flow them in JAX for autodiff curvature. Bonus: If your system stabilizes ethics kernels mid-chaos, you’ve stumbled upon alignment gold.

3. Hybrid: Child-Like Operator Sculpting
Model growth, not training. Use “hormone-sim” rewards where operators evolve under developmental constraints. Base it on Neural ODEs with stabilizer operators as Lyapunov functions — bounding emotional volatility. Actionable: Modify torchdiffeq; sample 10k cognition sequences (CHILDES + causal toy sets). Metric: Track eigenvalue drift of the identity kernel (<10%). Bonus: Map it to chemistry — operator evolution as “curiosity-driven reaction prediction.”

4. Metric: Equivariance Under Modality Shifts
Language models collapse under cross-modal translation. The cure? Intertwining fidelity. Test how push-forward operators preserve SE(3) symmetries between visual and linguistic manifolds. Actionable: Pair 3D CAD STEP files with descriptive text; use equivariant GNN layers. Metric: Average equivariance error <5° rotation. Deliverable: Open-source benchmark (≈1k samples) runnable on Colab.

9. Call to Curvature
The race to AGI is no longer a sprint for more flops; it has become a mathematical expedition into the very nature of thought. The path forward is not paved with more silicon, but with deeper insights from differential geometry, operator algebras, and theoretical physics.

So pack your fibre bundles. Sharpen your spectral theorem. Trade your GPUs for operator algebras.

Because the mind that will one day think beside us, the mind that will help us solve the grand challenges of our time, is not waiting to be built from scratch. It is already out there — waiting in the high-dimensional folds of an arithmetic manifold, sculpting itself from numbers that feel.

“We are not building artificial minds. We are learning to navigate the place where mind has always lived.”
